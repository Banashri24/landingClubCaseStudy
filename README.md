## General Information
  ## Project Information
  The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.
  
  ## Project Background
  This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
  
  Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

  ##Problem Statement
  The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
 
   ##Dataset
   The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.


## Conclusions
1. Burrowers not from large urban cities like California, new york, texas, floridaetc.
2. Burrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000.
3. Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value.
4. Burrowers with working experience 10+ years.
5. Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved
loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more
than 12000
6. Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan
default.
